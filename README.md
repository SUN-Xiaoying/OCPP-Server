# OCPP Server

> That's truly desperate to see my own tech debt.
> 1. DB redesign needed. Take `Reservation` for example, there are **3** ids in one table, where one Id could relate to the others. It's ok for a small project, but when it coming to a bigger scale, the memory cost would be **ridiculous**.
> 2. FP reformat needed. Xiao, you didn't even use `@Builder` in the whole project, how could you graduate?
> 3. SQL script needed. 
> 4. Docker! Docker! Docker! I'm telling you No one could run this project locally.
